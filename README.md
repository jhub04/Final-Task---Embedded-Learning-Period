# Final Task - Embedded Learning Period
This repository contains my solution to the final task of the embedded systems learning period at Vortex NTNU. The project consists of combining USART + PWM(TCC) to control an LED's brightness via PWM duty cycle by sending commands over the serial terminal. The microprocessor used for this project is SAME54P20A
